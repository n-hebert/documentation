# Run Pomerium Core With Docker

Run Pomerium Core with Docker containers in **under 5 minutes**.

The Core quickstart uses Pomerium's [**Hosted Authenticate Service**](/docs/capabilities/hosted-authenticate-service), but you can also configure a [**self-hosted authenticate service**](/docs/capabilities/self-hosted-authenticate-service) to integrate with Pomerium.

## Prerequisites

[Docker] and [Docker Compose]

## Configure Pomerium

Create a `config.yaml` file in the root of your project.

Add the configuration below to `config.yaml`:

<ConfigDocker />

## Configure Docker

Create a `docker-compose.yaml` file in the root of your project.

Add the configuration below to `docker-compose.yaml`:

<DockerCompose />

## Run Docker Compose

```bash
docker compose up
```

Access the **verify route** you built in your policy: `https://verify.localhost.pomerium.io`

If you get a self-signed certificate warning, see [Handle Self-Signed Certificate Warning](/docs/internals/troubleshooting#handle-self-signed-certificate-warning) to bypass it.

You should be redirected to the **verify** service. You'll see a page like this:

![Verify page](./img/quickstart/verify-service.png)

Don't worry, you didn't fail! This is a major milestone â€” it means your instance of Pomerium is now integrated with the upstream Verify service (and that the Verify service is working to reject you as it is unable to get the JWT).

So let's take a quick recap:

- You are currently running Pomerium in Docker. It's connected to your upstream app (the Verify) with a `from:` and `to:` proxy rerouting set.

- *Pomerium* is working, but the upstream app is expecting a [certificates](/docs/concepts/certificates) for the TLS handshake and a [JWT signing key](https://www.pomerium.com/docs/reference/signing-key).

The next step after this is to get both of these working in order to successfully consider this proxy routing successful.

:::tip

See [Identity Verification](/docs/capabilities/getting-users-identity) for more information on how Pomerium can use JWTs for authentication.

<!--- Comment for Zach: Here, I think we need to add the steps for making Quickstart work towards the Identity verified! page. --->


## Next Steps

If you want to try connecting Pomerium with other services, see some of our [Guides](/docs/guides).
<!--- Let's add a Guide like "Your first route!" then link to it as the primary option, then the other guides as secondaries--->

**Did you finish this quickstart guide?** We'd love to hear what you think. Get in touch with us on our [Discuss forum](https://discuss.pomerium.com/), message us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pomerium_io), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/pomerium-inc), or check out our [Community](https://www.pomerium.com/docs/community) page.

:::caution

This is a test environment! If you followed all the steps in this doc your Pomerium environment is not using trusted certificates. Remember to use a valid certificate solution before moving this configuration to a production environment. See [Certificates](/docs/concepts/certificates) for more information.
