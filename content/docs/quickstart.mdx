# Run Pomerium Core With Docker

Run Pomerium Core with Docker containers in **under 5 minutes**.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Hosted Pomerium" label="Hosted Pomerium">

These steps cover how to run Pomerium Core with our [**Hosted Authenticate Service**](/docs/capabilities/hosted-authenticate-service).

## Before you start

You need [Docker] and [Docker Compose]

## Set up Pomerium

Create a `config.yaml` file in the root of your project.

Add the configuration below to `config.yaml`:

<HostedConfigDocker />

See [detailed configuration](/docs/reference/) settings.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Self-hosted Pomerium" label="Self-hosted Pomerium">

These steps cover how to run Pomerium Core with the [**Self-hosted Authenticate Service**](/docs/capabilities/self-hosted-authenticate-service).

## Before you start

You need:
- [Docker]
- [Docker Compose]
- A configured [Identity Provider](/docs/identity-providers)

## Set up Pomerium

Create a `config.yaml` file in the root of your project.

Add the configuration below to `config.yaml`:

<SelfHostedConfigDocker />

See [detailed configuration](/docs/reference/) settings.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Set up Docker

Create a `docker-compose.yaml` file in the root of your project.

Add the configuration below to `docker-compose.yaml`:

<DockerCompose />

## Run Docker Compose

```bash
docker compose up
```

## Access the Verify service

Access the **verify route** you built in your policy: `https://verify.localhost.pomerium.io`

You should be redirected to the **verify** service. You'll see a page like this:

![Verify page](./img/quickstart/verify-service.png)

Although identity verification failed, you successfully integrated Pomerium with the upstream verify service.

:::tip

Because this guide doesn't include a [signing key](/docs/reference/signing-key) in the configuration, identity verification will fail.

See [Identity Verification](/docs/capabilities/getting-users-identity) for more information on how Pomerium can use JWTs for authentication.

:::

If you get a self-signed certificate warning, see [Handle Self-Signed Certificate Warning](/docs/internals/troubleshooting#handle-self-signed-certificate-warning) to bypass it.

## Next Steps

If you want to [try Enterprise](https://www.pomerium.com/enterprise-sales/), check out the [Enterprise with Docker quickstart](/docs/deploy/enterprise/quickstart).

If you want to try connecting Pomerium with other services, see some of our [Guides](/docs/guides).

**Did you finish this quickstart guide?** We'd love to hear what you think. Get in touch with us on our [Discuss forum](https://discuss.pomerium.com/), message us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pomerium_io), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/pomerium-inc), or check out our [Community](https://www.pomerium.com/docs/community) page.

:::caution

This is a test environment! If you followed all the steps in this doc your Pomerium environment is not using trusted certificates. Remember to use a valid certificate solution before moving this configuration to a production environment. See [Certificates](/docs/concepts/certificates) for more information.
