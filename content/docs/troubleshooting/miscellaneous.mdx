# Miscellaneous Issues

### Invalid Certificates from Command Line Tools

When using Let's Encrypt certificates, you must use the `fullchain.pem` file, not `cert.pem` in order to include intermediate certs. Browsers like Chrome will store intermediate certs for LE but other tools (like `curl`) don't, which is why your route might look fine in a web browser, but not when curl'd or used for TCP tunneling.

### Handle self-signed certificate warning

If you're testing Pomerium locally with self-signed certificates, you may encounter the following self-signed certificate warning:

![Proceed to the Verify app](./img/self-signed-cert-warning/pomerium-proceed-to-verify.png)

To resolve this error:

1. Select **Advanced**
1. Select **Proceed to verify.localhost.pomerium.io (unsafe)**

If you don't see an **Advanced** option:

1. Click anywhere in the window
1. Type `thisisunsafe`
1. Make sure **Reload** is selected
1. Select **Enter**

Your browser will redirect you to the route defined in your policy.

## Envoy error messages

Because Pomerium relies on Envoy to manage HTTP connections, you will notice Envoy connection errors and messages at some point in your logs as you configure Pomerium.

The [Envoy Response Code Details](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/configuration/http/http_conn_man/response_code_details.html) provides an exhaustive list of Envoy-related message details.

We've repurposed a truncated version of the Response Code Details list in the table below for your convenience:

| **Name** | **Description** |
| :-- | :-- |
| absolute_path_rejected | The request was rejected due to using an absolute path on a route not supporting them. |
| admin_filter_response | The response was generated by the admin filter. |
| cluster_not_found | The request was rejected by the router filter because there was no cluster found for the selected route. |
| downstream_local_disconnect | The client connection was locally closed for the provided reason. |
| downstream_remote_disconnect | The client disconnected unexpectedly. |
| duration_timeout | The max connection duration was exceeded. |
| direct_response | A direct response was generated by the router filter. |
| filter_added_invalid_request_data | A filter added request data at the wrong stage in the filter chain. |
| filter_added_invalid_response_data | A filter added response data at the wrong stage in the filter chain. |
| filter_chain_not_found | The request was rejected due to no matching filter chain. |
| filter_removed_required_request_headers | The request was rejected in the filter manager because a configured filter removed required request headers. |
| filter_removed_required_response_headers | The response was rejected in the filter manager because a configured filter removed required response headers or these values were invalid (e.g. overflown status). |
| internal_redirect | The original stream was replaced with an internal redirect. |
| low_version | The HTTP/1.0 or HTTP/0.9 request was rejected due to HTTP/1.0 support not being configured. |
| maintenance_mode | The request was rejected by the router filter because the cluster was in maintenance mode. |
| max_duration_timeout | The per-stream max duration timeout was exceeded. |
| missing_host_header | The request was rejected due to a missing Host: or :authority field. |
| missing_path_rejected | The request was rejected due to a missing Path or :path header field. |
| no_healthy_upstream | The request was rejected by the router filter because there was no healthy upstream found. |
| overload | The request was rejected due to the Overload Manager reaching configured resource limits. |
| rejecting_because_detection_failed | The request was rejected because the original IP couldnâ€™t be detected. |
| path_normalization_failed | The request was rejected because path normalization was configured on and failed, probably due to an invalid path. |
| request_headers_failed_strict_check | The request was rejected due to x-envoy-\* headers failing strict header validation. |
| request_overall_timeout | The per-stream total request timeout was exceeded. |
| request_payload_exceeded_retry_buffer_limit | Envoy is doing streaming proxying but too much data arrived while waiting to attempt a retry. |
| request_payload_too_large | Envoy is doing non-streaming proxying and the request payload exceeded configured limits. |
| response_payload_too_large | Envoy is doing non-streaming proxying and the response payload exceeded configured limits. |
| route_configuration_not_found | The request was rejected because there was no route configuration found. |
| route_not_found | The request was rejected because there was no route found. |
| stream_idle_timeout | The per-stream keepalive timeout was exceeded. |
| upgrade_failed | The request was rejected because it attempted an unsupported upgrade. |
| upstream_max_stream_duration_reached | The request was destroyed because of it exceeded the configured max stream duration. |
| upstream_per_try_timeout | The final upstream try timed out. |
| upstream_reset_after_response_started | The upstream connection was reset after a response was started. This may include further details about the cause of the disconnect. |
| upstream_reset_before_response_started | The upstream connection was reset before a response was started This may include further details about the cause of the disconnect. |
| upstream_response_timeout | The upstream response timed out. |
| via_upstream | The response code was set by the upstream. |
