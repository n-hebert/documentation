# Miscellaneous Issues

### Invalid Certificates from Command Line Tools

When using Let's Encrypt certificates, you must use the `fullchain.pem` file, not `cert.pem` in order to include intermediate certs. Browsers like Chrome will store intermediate certs for LE but other tools (like `curl`) don't, which is why your route might look fine in a web browser, but not when curl'd or used for TCP tunneling.

### Handle self-signed certificate warning

If you're testing Pomerium locally with self-signed certificates, you may encounter the following self-signed certificate warning:

![Proceed to the Verify app](./img/miscellaneous/self-signed-cert-warning/pomerium-proceed-to-verify.png)

To resolve this error:

1. Select **Advanced**
1. Select **Proceed to verify.localhost.pomerium.io (unsafe)**

If you don't see an **Advanced** option:

1. Click anywhere in the window
1. Type `thisisunsafe`
1. Make sure **Reload** is selected
1. Select **Enter**

Your browser will redirect you to the route defined in your policy.
