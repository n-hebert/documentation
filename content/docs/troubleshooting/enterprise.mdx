## Pomerium Enterprise

### Generate Recovery Token

### Directory sync

**Problem:**

Enterprise Console directory sync fails to complete.

**Solution:**

If your directory sync fails, use the **External Data** > **Last Error** and **Metrics** dashboards to determine the source of the failure, and review your Console logs as well. If the failure is due to a timeout, increase the **IdP Polling Min/Max Delay** settings until the sync completes.

1. In the Console, go to **External Data** > **Last Error** to check for errors that may have caused the sync to fail. Go to **External Data** > **Metrics** to review request durations:

2. Select **Settings** > **Identity Providers** to see the **IdP Polling Min/Max Delay** settings. Increase the **Polling Min Delay** and **Polling Max Delay** settings before attempting to sync your directory again. Continue to monitor the sync; if it fails due to timeout, increase the durations.

See [**Identity Provider Polling Min/Max Delay**](/docs/reference/identity-provider-settings#identity-provider-polling-minmax-delay) for more information.

### Case sensitive values

Configuration file keys and environment variables of the type `string` are case sensitive. This is important when configuring the Enterprise Console or adding claims to your configuration file.

For example, the `administrators` key allows you to specify a list of names, email addresses, or user IDs as initial administrators to access and configure the Enterprise Console. These string values are case sensitive.

If you wanted to add an email address like `John.Admin@example.com` to the `administrators` file key, Pomerium wouldn't recognize an email like `john.admin@example` because the strings aren't an exact match.
